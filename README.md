A simple web application that allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID number, using the PokeAPI.
The app displays detailed information about each Pokémon, including its image, name, stats, moves, and abilities. 
Was created with with no external js or css libaries.

This project was created as part of a school course assignment to explore API usage and frontend development.

Features:
    Search by name or ID
    Displayed image, stats, moves and abilities
    Tries to look like a pokedex

Project was a fun experiment and teached me a lot of new things regardign the use of api. 
The project was especiallly fun because Pokemons are just so cute and I hapen to be a little bit of a fan. 
I would rate this project a solid 5/5, I had a fun time working on it!
